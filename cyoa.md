# Choose your own adventure!

In this exercise, I want *you* to pick a text or network analysis tool from [this list](http://dirtdirectory.org/search/node/%22text%20analysis%22%20OR%20network) or [this one](http://dhresourcesforprojectbuilding.pbworks.com/w/page/69244314/Tutorials%20for%20DH%20Tools%20and%20Methods) and figure out how to use it. You can use our version of the [Colonial Newspaper Database](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shawngraham/exercise/gh-pages/CND.csv) as your source text. Write up your own basic tutorial explaining what the tool does, how you got it to work on your data, and what you think it might be telling us or be useful for. Fork and add the link to your tutorial (which you'll have as a .md file in your repository) to this document.
